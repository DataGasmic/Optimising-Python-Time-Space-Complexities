# Optimising-Python-Time-Space-Complexities

Python and it's multiple libraries can be used to perform several fucntions from Processing , Exploring and Modifying data from datasets. This repository is to represent all the simple and complex methods that I learnt over the years to optimize Python Code to reduce Space and Time Complexities of various functions

1. Optimising Pandas Data Processing Speed - going from basic loops to lambda expressions and finally vectorisation

2. Using LRU_Cache to improve the Time Complexity of Python Recursive Call based functions using functools
